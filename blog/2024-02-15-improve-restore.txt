<p>The Pleasant Hill Instructional Garden is a certified wildlife habitat with the National Wildlife Federation and a registered monarch butterfly waystation, which means it provides for the four basic needs of wildlife: food, water, shelter, and a place to raise young. The garden demonstrates healthy garden practices using no pesticides, water conservation and water recycling methods, with drought-tolerant and native plantings.
To provide water and increase habitat value, a bubbler on a large rock was provided as part of an Eagle Scout
project. Current efforts include restoring the trickle of water in the dry streambed powered by a solar pump from
our solar panels.</p>

<p>In some areas of the garden, whether due to vandalism or carelessness, beds have been compacted from walking, which means a loss of our special plants, an increase of weeds, and more runoff. Grasses that provide nesting areas for butterflies and other insects have been trampled. While a sign in the garden asks people to stay on the path, a protective barrier such as a fence and/or barrier plants may be needed for wildlife habitat. Because the garden recycles and reuses not only water but materials of all kinds, some of the garden prunings could be used to create a natural looking fence. Other plant trimmings are often reused to create lizard houses.</p>

<p>PHIG participates in the annual bird count and other citizen science projects to observe and log wildlife in the garden. More varieties of birds are seen every year. Western bluebirds have returned to the area and find food and refuge in the garden. We provide a nesting box that protects against predators for them. The post for the nesting box needs to be replaced with a taller one prior to nesting season. Providing for birds means giving them a safe place. Plants that form barriers help ground nesting birds. Protection is needed for tree-nesting birds.</p>

<p>Additionally, restoration of the beds will include preparing the soil, weeding, pruning, replanting pollinator plants, and improving paths to provide limited access.</p>
